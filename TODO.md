# TODO list
## System dependencies
- [ ] Test the code on new computers
- [ ] create a dependences.txt

~~[ ] Test the code on docker~~

## How to use
### Run a demo
- [X] demo to generate data
- [X] demo to infer overlap and yaw between two frames
- [X] demo combined with M-distance for whole KITTI00 (visulizer and Mdistance-file)
- [X] demo to generate ground truth overlap and yaw


### Train and evaluate a Network
- [X] scripts to genarate depth, normal, intensity, semantic maps
- [X] scripts to genarate overlap and yaw mapping files
- [X] scripts to generate training and test files, including data normalization
- [X] scripts to generate evaluation files


### pretrained models and preprocessed dataset for KITTI00
#### Models
- [X] geometric only

~~[ ] all channel~~

#### preprocessed data
- [X] link to raw dataset for KITTI00
